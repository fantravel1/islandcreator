    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq">
      <details>
        <summary>What animals are in the game?</summary>
        <p>6 species: Deer, Rabbit, Wolf, and Hawk are available from the start. Fox unlocks when your ecosystem reaches C-grade (45+ score), and Sea Turtle unlocks at B-grade (60+ score).</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How does animal AI work?</summary>
        <p>Each animal has individual AI. Herbivores seek food and water while fleeing predators. Predators hunt, form packs, and establish territories. All animals reproduce, age, and can die from starvation, thirst, predation, or old age.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What are notable animals?</summary>
        <p>Animals achieving remarkable feats earn names (Sage, Shadow, Storm, etc.) and titles ("the Apex" for 10+ kills, "the Matriarch" for 8+ children, "the Ancient" for 800+ days old). Their stories are tracked in the narrative journal.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How many animals can my island have?</summary>
        <p>Up to 200 animals with automatic population balancing. The optimal range for the best ecosystem score is 20 to 150 animals with good species diversity.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How does predator-prey balance work?</summary>
        <p>It follows natural population dynamics. Too many predators deplete prey, leading to predator decline, which then allows prey recovery. You can influence this with governance policies like hunting limits and conservation zones.</p>
